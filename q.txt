The available functions include list_directory, which is meant to list the contents of a directory. The parameters require an absolute path. Since the user didn't specify a particular directory, the default should be the current working directory. So I need to call list_directory with the absolute path of the current directory. But wait, how do I get the absolute path of the current directory? The function's parameter is a string, so maybe the user expects the current directory's absolute path. I'll assume that the current working directory is the one to list. Therefore, the function call should be list_directory with the absolute path as the current directory. Let me make sure there's no other function that's more appropriate. The glob function can find files matching a pattern, but the user just wants a list of files. So list_directory is the right choice. I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n",
