Since the user is asking if I know their name, I should use that function to retrieve any stored information. If there's no memory, I'll need to inform them I don't have their name yet.

I should confirm that I know their name and maybe mention the favorite color since that's also stored. But the main answer is to state their name. I need to make sure the response is friendly and addresses their question directly.\n</think>\n\n안녕하세요, 김철수님! 저는 귀하의 이름을 알고 있습니다. 또한, 귀하가 가장 좋아하는 색깔이 파란색이라는 사실도 기억하고 있어요. 도움이 필요하시면 언제든지 말씀해주세요!"
